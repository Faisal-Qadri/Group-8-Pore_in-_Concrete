As a way of variety, each student tried to deviate a little from the main work. The main work is to build an algorithm that will be able to identify porosity for images from the testing data set. Start writing about porosity, we saw from the explanatory data analysis that the porosity for each batch is normally distributed. Also, from the second plot, it is shown the frequency of porosity within each batch, and the average values of porosity for batch 1 is 18.52% and for batch 2 is 12.17% which are reasonable. The reason behind this explanatory data analysis is to see how porosity distributed among all images in each batch and identify if there is any image that could have unreasonable values. We also figured out that
